# How do I add my own textures?
- There is a "textures" folder in the mod folder. The mod will select a random image from this folder every time a providence is spawned.
- If you're using r2modman, go to settings, then "Browse profile folder". Once you're in the profile folder, go into "BepInEx" then "plugins", then look for the mod folder. Inside there should be a "CustomProvidence" folder. The "textures" folder should be inside that one.
- If, for some reason, there is no "textures" folder, you can create one yourself in the same folder as CustomProvidence.dll. 

# Manual Installation
- Install BepInEx
- Download this mod by pressing "Manual Download"
- Inside there should be a plugins folder. And inside that one there should be a CustomProvidence folder
- Drag the CustomProvidence folder to BepInEx/plugins
- Enjoy!
