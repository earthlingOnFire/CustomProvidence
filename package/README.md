# How do I add my own textures?
- There is a "textures" folder in the mod folder. The mod will select a random image from this folder every time a providence is spawned.
- If you're using r2modman, go to settings, then "Browse profile folder". Once you're in the profile folder, go into "BepInEx" then "plugins", then look for "CustomProvidence". The "textures" folder should be inside.

# Manual Installation
- Install BepInEx
- Drag the CustomProvidence folder to BepInEx/plugins
- Enjoy!
