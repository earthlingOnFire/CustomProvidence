# How do I add my own textures?
- Open the game and look for the configgy menu.
- There should be an "Open Textures Folder" button. Click it to open the mod's appdata folder (generating upon starting the game with the mod installed).
- Inside there is a "textures" folder. The mod will select a random image from this folder every time a providence is spawned.
- There is also an optional "rare textures" folder. You can set the probability for images to be picked from that folder instead of the regular one in the Configgy menu.
